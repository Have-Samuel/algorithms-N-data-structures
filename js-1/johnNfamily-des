### John and Family

John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants, The bills were $124m, $48, and $268.

To tip the waiter a fair amount, john created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:

- Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
- Containing all three final paid amounts(bill + tip).
